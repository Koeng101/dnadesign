# Default codon tables

Here are a collection of decent default codon tables. I've included Pichia patoris, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Escherichia coli.

The Escherichia coli table was derived from the FreqB table from the paper "[Design Parameters to Control Synthetic Gene Expression in Escherichia coli](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007002)". Pichia patoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were derived directly from their genome.

This is a work-in-progress as we aim to cover more genomes.
